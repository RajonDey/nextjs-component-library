# Data Grid Feature

A unified component combining Pagination, Search Filters, and Data Table for a complete data management solution. Standalone components remain available for modularity.

## Features
- **Pagination**: Navigate pages with prev/next and numbered buttons.
- **Search Filters**: Filter data with text search and category dropdown.
- **Data Table**: Display paginated, filtered data in a table.
- Responsive and branded with NextLibâ€™s design system.

## How It Was Built
- **Component**: Client Component (`"use client"`) integrating `Pagination`, `SearchFilters`, and `DataTable`.
- **Styling**: Inherits branding from sub-components (`brand-primary`, `brand-secondary`, `brand-bg`).
- **Demo**: A page (`/data-grid`) with dummy data showcasing the unified experience.
